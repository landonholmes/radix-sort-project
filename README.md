To run this wonderful project, simply drag the index.html file into the browser of your choice

There is no need to compile anything as everything in this project is written using JavaScript or HTML, which all browsers can interpret (even without an internet connection!)

Once opened in the browser, click the "About" tab at the top to be given an accurate description on the usage of this sorting mechanism.
